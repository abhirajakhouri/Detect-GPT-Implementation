# Detect-GPT-Implementation
Part of coursework of Probabilistic Machine Learning (CS772)

The following project is an implementation of 'DetectGPT' and its subsequent papers and an attempt to look for novel improvements. I would thank the authors of the above papers for their researchwork. 

Note: In-depth experimentation using large datasets was infeasible due to limited GPU access & might be taken on in future endeavours.
